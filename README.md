# vscode-cdp

This package exports strongly-typed client and server implementations for the
[Chrome DevTools Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/).
These implementations are extensible with additional domains, and some handling
of sessions and sockets is also included out of the box.

## Quickstart

Most likely, you're using this as a consumer of a CDP server (e.g. a browser or
[js-debug](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-js-debug/blob/main/CDP_SHARE.md)).

```ts
import { Connection, WebSocketTransport } from "@vscode/cdp";

// Acquire your connection to a browser, somehow, and then create a typed CDP wrapper.
const myWebSocket = await connectToBrowser();
const cdpClient = Connection.client(new WebSocketTransport(myWebSocket));

// You can then call methods in a strongly-typed way...
await cdpClient.rootSession.api.Debugger.enable();

// and also listen to them!
cdpClient.rootSession.api.Debugger.onPaused((evt) => {
	console.log(evt.callFrames);
});
```

## Advanced Scenarios

### Custom Domains

By default, the `Connection.client` will by typed with the domains exposed by V8
and Chrome. However, this package also exports the undocumented Node.js-specific
domains, and you can mix in custom domains. For example:

```ts
import {
	Connection,
	WebSocketTransport,
	CdpV8,
	CdpBrowser,
	CdpNode,
} from "@vscode/cdp";
// Uses "MyCustomDomains" from the Server Implementation section below:
type AllMyDomains = CdpV8.Domains &
	CdpBrowser.Domains &
	CdpNode.Domains &
	MyCustomDomains;
const cdpClient = Connection.client<AllMyDomains>(
	new WebSocketTransport(myWebSocket),
);
```

### Server Implementation

You can also implement a CDP server. Once again, this is all strongly-typed.
You'll want to pass in a generic to `Connection.server` which is a map of domain
names to `IDomain` interfaces, which define methods and events:

```ts
interface MyCustomDomains {
	Greeter: {
		events: {
			didGreet: { params: string };
		};
		requests: {
			hello: {
				params: { name: string; emit?: boolean; throw?: boolean };
				result: { greeting: string };
			};
		};
	};
}

webSocketServer.on("connection", (ws) => {
	const cdpServer = Connection.server<MyCustomDomains>(
		new WebSocketTransport(ws),
	);

	cdpServer.rootSession.api = {
		Greeter: {
			async hello(client, args) {
				client.Greeter.didGreet(args.name);
				return { greeting: `Hello ${args.name}!` };
			},
		},
	};
});
```
